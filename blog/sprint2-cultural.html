                Sooner or later, each person will have to make an important decision: in which direction to continue their pathway and development. We all imagine what our future will look like, what we will be doing and how we will be living.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">My long term goals</strong><br>
                My current long term goal is to become a professional developer. In the next year, I plan on focusing on front-end development so I can become skilled in it. Iâ€™m very interested in gaining the experience and developing the associated skills related to my new career and making the connections and networking with the people in IT field who can help me achieve my goals. I'd like to develop and improve some personal skills like communication, networking and teamwork.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">My strengths and limitations</strong><br>
                I hope my strengths will help me to become a professional developer. I enjoy solving problems. I seek new challenges and try to think out-of-the-box while looking for creative solutions to a given problem. But I need to work on some of my weakness. My greatest weakness is a public speaking. Speaking in front of the large group makes me nervous. Sometimes I have shortness of breath, increased heart rate, and oxygen intake. I think public speaking is an important skill to know when I want to offer my opinion during a meeting, so I need to work on it.<br>
                Another my goals are developing and maintaining good study habits like planing, keeping a consistent, daily study routine, avoiding procrastination. I'm working on it now. I'm going to attend meetups, as they allow to meet other people who share my interests and build connections, exchange ideas and share experiences. I hope Bootcamp will help me to develop communication skills as I have no experience of working in a team as a web developer.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">What if I get stuck...</strong><br>
                If I get stuck, I make a cup of tea/coffee and think what I can do to unstuck myself)) The first what I do I try again to breakdown the tricky part. If it doesn't work, I'm trying to find a new explanation through a Google search. I can discuss the problem with my team on Slack or ask for help my course faciitator. It would be nice to receive a feedback from my facilitator too.
