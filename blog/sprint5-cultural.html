                <strong class="font-weight-bold">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong><br>
                <ol>
                    <li>I'm enjoying problem-solving and challenging myself, trying new features while writing the code.</li>
                    <li>I feel so good when I see the result of my work. It's very inspiring.</li>
                    <li>I need to change my Fixed Mindset into a Growth Mindset. I can't say I've got a 100% Fixed Mindset, but I have what I'd like to change.</li>
                </ol>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong><br>
                Self-awareness is the ability to see yourself clearly and objectively through reflection and introspection. It allows us to see things from the perspective of others, practice self-control, work creatively and productively, and experience pride in ourselves and our work as well as general self-esteem. Self-awareness can make us better at our jobs, better communicators in the workplace, and enhance our self-confidence and job-related wellbeing.<br>
                If we are talking about Empathy, it allows us to build social connections with other people. Empathy can help you better understand other people, their feelings and whatâ€™s driving their behavior if you look at them without any judgment. Also empathy can help us to learn how to regulate our own emotions. It allows you to manage what you are feeling in the difficult situation or even in times of great stress without becoming overwhelmed.<br>
                So, as you can see Self-awareness and Empathy are very important and powerful tools that you can use in your learning process and promote high commitment and cooperation in the workplace.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong><br>
                Growth Mindset Theory. It gives a hope. Love it.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong><br>
                Practicing meditation. It's not easy for me, so it seems I need more practice.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong><br>
                Studying programming is not only about studying how write a code. It's also studying who you are as a human, the ways to grow as a person, how communicate with other people. I think all this things are important if you'd like to be a successful programmer.<br>
                <strong class="font-weight-bold">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong><br>
                Studying core learning wasn't a waste of time for me. I think this information gives us an opportunity to have a look at ourselves, reflex who we are and who we'd like to see in the mirror.<br>
