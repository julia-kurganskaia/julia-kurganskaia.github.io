                What language do you speak? What is your religion? What holidays do you celebrate? What are your values?<br>
                In general our values are the things that we believe are important in the way we live and work. Many theorists believe that culture is an important shaper of our personality and values. Culture helps define how individuals see themselves and how they relate to others.<br>
                I was born and raised in Russia. I have been living in New Zealand for about 10 years. I identify myself as a Russian Kiwi now. I love Russia and New Zealand for beautiful nature, soulful people, unique culture. Both of them are multicultural countries. They contain an incredible diversity of people, beliefs, values and lifestyles.<br>
                I value many things, but I think my top values are: family, health, happiness, life balance, "golden rule" ("Treat others as you would like others to treat you"), empathy, fairness, security, commitment, learning, professionalism.<br>
                I belive culture affects our values — what we consider right and wrong. This is how the society we live in influences our choices. But our choices can also influence others and ultimately help shape our society. I think life is a constant ethical decision, one after another. We make a choice every single day. Do you drive faster than the speed limit or don't you? Do you sort your rubbish and recycling? Do you keep your promise? Do you treat others as you would like others to treat you? What do you choose?<br>
                I’d say one of my greatest strengths is an open-mindedness. I believe being open to other ideas can open you up to new experiences. Also, communication is another of my greatest strengths. I'm a good team-player. I really like working with people who are committed to getting things done and who are passionate about their work.<br>
                My weakness is that I can focus too much on the small details, spending a lot of time on the fine points making sure everything is perfect, which can often lead to taking more time than needed on something. Sometimes I have to remind to myself that best is the enemy of the good.
