                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Problem? Problem... Not a problem! Maybe...</strong><br>
                    Sometimes a problem is not a problem at all (Thank you, Captain Obvious!) When I'm reading the first few lines in a problem, I often think: "I have NO IDEA what to do!". That's my panic point. But! I know I need to stay calm and read the task several times, until fully understand it. Well, it doesn't work in my case sometimes. My example is the <code>deBee</code> function. I thought I understood the problem and I wrote the function without using <code>filter()</code> and <code>toLowerCase()</code> methods. Then, I wrote the second <code>deBee</code> function using <code>toLowerCase()</code> method, but without <code>filter()</code>. And only the third <code>deBee</code> function I've wrote was with <code>filter()</code> and <code>toLowerCase()</code> methods. All three functions are doing the same work, but the last one is shorter and more elegant, just 3 lines of code. I'm happy :)<br>

                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Pseudocode</strong><br>
                    I can't say I often use Pseudocode technique. Maybe it would be better to use it more frequently, because Pseudocode is a detailed description of what a program must do, this can help me write every line of code needed in order to solve the problem.<br>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Trying something in Console</strong><br>
                    I like trying code in Console. I take very simple examples and find the output. Then I take more complex and bigger inputs to see what will be the output. Console is a good tool for experiments with code. I'm using debugger to see what code is doing. Debugging helps me catch any syntax errors or gaps in logic.<br>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Rubber ducky method</strong><br>
                    The best way to know if you understand the problem is by being able to explain it to someone else. So... Sometimes I ask my husband to be my Rubber Ducky. He is a brilliant one!

                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Googling</strong><br>
                    I google not to find a solution, but to find ideas and check if methods I chose work as I'm expecting.<br>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Asking your peers for help</strong><br>
                    I think there is absolutely nothing wrong in asking for help to solve a programming problem. Every programmer needs help time to time. I haven't ask my peers for help yet, but I will if I need it.<br>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Asking coaches for help</strong><br>
                    I haven't asked yet, but I feel confident to do it.<br>
                  <strong class="font-weight-bold">Improving your process with reflection</strong><br>
                    I'm doing reflection after each task. Especially if task was difficult for me. Reflection helps me analyse what I've done and understand what can be improved.
